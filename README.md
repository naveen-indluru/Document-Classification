# Text Classification Using Naive Bayes

This project focuses on performing **text classification** using both the **Multinomial Naive Bayes** implementation from `sklearn` and a custom-built Naive Bayes classifier from scratch. The project compares the performance of the custom Naive Bayes implementation with the standard `sklearn` model.

## Project Overview

- **Objective**: 
  1. Perform text classification using **Multinomial Naive Bayes** (already implemented in `sklearn`).
  2. Build Naive Bayes from scratch for text classification.
  3. Compare the results of both implementations.

- **Dataset**: The dataset can be accessed via [this link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/17asj7qWkdqDYcPTVjgG-i71fX4Pt1oZM?usp=sharing).

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: 
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - scikit-learn (sklearn)
  - matplotlib
  - tqdm
## Project Tasks

1. **Text Classification with Multinomial Naive Bayes**:
   - Use `sklearn`'s Multinomial Naive Bayes to perform classification.
   
2. **Custom Naive Bayes Implementation**:
   - Implement the Naive Bayes algorithm from scratch.
   
3. **Model Comparison**:
   - Compare the accuracy and performance metrics (precision, recall, confusion matrix) between the `sklearn` implementation and the custom Naive Bayes model.

## Features

- **Data Preparation**:
  - Tokenization, stopword removal, and vocabulary building.
  
- **Naive Bayes Models**:
  - Comparison of Multinomial Naive Bayes (`sklearn`) and custom Naive Bayes implementation.
  
- **Performance Evaluation**:
  - Detailed performance evaluation using confusion matrix and classification reports.
